## 1 Introduction and Maps I

### 1.1 Introduction to nonlinear dynamics

**Deterministic systems** are sensitive to inicial conditions, they are not random, cause and effect are linked, the present state affects future states. **Dynamic systems** evolve with time. **Nonlinear systems** have importante variables with nonlinear relationships. **Chaotic systems** are _nonlinear_ and _dynamic_. Complex behavior arises from simple deterministic nonlinear systems.

Our basic study of behavior in nature is based on the pressumption of linear behavior, while the vast majority of natural behaviors that evolve in time are nonlinear. A large ammount of natural systems are chaotic and may not be studied utilizing only pen and paper, we need the help of computers with experimental mathmatics.

Loreenz in the 1963 paper Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow, was the first person to study the patterns of chaos and the sensitivity of the evolution of those systems within the context of those patterns. Li and Yorke in the paper Period Three Implies Chaos, were the first to use the word chaos to describe this behavior.
