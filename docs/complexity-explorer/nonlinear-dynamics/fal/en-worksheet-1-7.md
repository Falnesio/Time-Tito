# Logistic Map: Cobweb Plots and the Time Domain

Q3. The model enters a **Fixed State** determined by r.

Q4. After a while we find a periodic pattern appear. I think that it stabelizes into a state.

Q5. r = 3.828 appear chaotic and 3.8285 stablelizes like in question 4.

Q6. r = 3.25 two states, r = 3.900000000001 appears chaotic

Q7. r = 3.8521738 does appear to be periodic, but I do not know what a period 15 orbit is.
