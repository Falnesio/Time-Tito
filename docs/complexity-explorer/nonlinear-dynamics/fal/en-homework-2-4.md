# Question 1

Let bi be the ith value of the parameter r for which a bifurcation occurs 
in the first period-doubling cascade of the logistic map.  The r value for 
which the dynamics change from a fixed point to a periodic orbit is b1, for
example; the r value where the logistic map switches from period 2 to period 
4 is b2, and so on.

The Feigenbaum number Î´ is defined as

In the following problems, you will use the bifurcation tool that you developed in Homework 2.2 to determine the value of this constant.

d) Around 3.5645

f) delta = (3.58318261 - 3.58281225)/(3.583266922123 - 3.58318261) = 4.39272534985048
(3.597432291100075 - 3.597432068429)/(3.597432335650074 - 3.597432291100075) = 4.998228527595819
